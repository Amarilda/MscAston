DATA DICTIONARY

21/03/2021
I forgot to webscrape reddit yesterday. Did fall asleep at the middle of the Olsen Banden (the was unintentional, appears I have made amendments of use of the useless THE)
In a process of figuring out how to back-engineer yesterdays data, it was discovered that it is rolling 24 hour window for top. 

reddit.subreddit('worldnews').top(time_filter='day', limit=30)

I can increase the dataset before 09/03/2021. China's anal swabs can be part of the data set after all. Victory for the humanity.

09/03/2021
The issue was with new kind of the field. Omitted for now. I have link to the original post, if it proves to be useful, can go back and fill in missing. 
Dropped params and using top30 columns as params.

Said to Mr.Amazing that Boris Johnson got Covid (again). He challanged me. 
Old news, nice to know that Boris Johnson getin Covid is 19th most upvoted post EVER on r/worldnews.
So either way yestardays scrape will not be useful. 

top_posts = reddit.subreddit('worldnews').top(time_filter='day',limit=30)

try:
    eval(post._comments)
except:
    print("This is an error message!")

08/03/2021
... data types
First 30 are webscraped, exported to excel. It is 19:50 and I have 0 energy to figure out which column has the wrong date type. 
First time eval() was of use.

Unfortunately, this will not be in data set.
All you can blame is your own procrastination.
