The decay totally takes care of the rest. If you look at a 1 year + chart of UVXY, it's hard to find any 4 month period where if you were get puts in at a peak or even peak-ish moment and then 4 months later there isn't at least a few days where your put would have been well ITM. now, if the VIX settles to neutral as it's asymptotic trend seems to be doing, and/or we head for a consistently down market, this strategy doesn't work. But even in a super choppy up/down market, the decay factor of placing puts on a highly leveraged fund has been working well!

One night she told me she‚Äôd be taking next week off, so she could go meet her fiancees family. The craziest part of the story, is that her fianc√©e was an Amish guy who she met while working. She said as soon as he walked into the strip club he walked right over to her and told her she was the most beautiful creature he‚Äôd ever seen and they‚Äôd been together ever since. She was so nervous about meeting his family, she had to buy new outfits that covered her from the neck down because nothing she owned was modest enough. I guess my point is that if some Amish Chad isn‚Äôt afraid to introduce his black stripper girlfriend to his entire family, what the fuck is holding you back from living the life you want to live?

1566,US Commerce Department seeks to double tariffs on Canadian Lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%,0.9,"Gurgle.. gurgle.. gurgle... \*holding breath\* pffffffftt  \*Coughs\*

Many moons a-go during the depression people disassembled entire ghost towns to build their new home in the nearby larger town. Mining camps from the gold rush, and cattle stops from the Midwest were dissembled and used to build homes and outbuildings because the cost of goods and transportation of those good were too expensive then. Oh, coming to a theater near you in a decade or so. 

What caused this was at the end of the roaring 20s right before the margin bubble burst, the Govt. had issued tariffs (Smoot\_hawley act) on many soft commodities because use was so high but demand fell and prices still needed to be high (visibly) this was done under the guise of Nationalism. Shit fell apart anyways, we tried even deeper nationalistic legislation to no avail.

As we try this similar legislation, it is just to deflect the deflation that will hit the lumber market soon. All those orders to fill, placed 6 months to a year out, and we are already seeing the napalm hitting the fan. (I love the smell of ON/repo markets in the morning)

In reality, the index can't catch up with inflation.

Fed is both better equipped and politically more independent than Turkish CB. Even if they weren't, people would flee to gold and less inflationary foreign currency and stock market would have troubles catching up with inflation. Solid companies that can increase their earnings percentages in an inflationary environment too.

We have fucking extremely cheap stocks but shit won't change until there is a political change in my country.

Just about every relationship or hookup I‚Äôve ever had started at the bar or with alcohol involved.  Last weekend I got a booty call from a former FWB that I used to drink a lot with and hookup.  She texted at around midnight right as I was heading to bed.  She was at the bar and I told her she could stop by and she said it wouldn‚Äôt be until around 2.  I really thought about it and although it has been 2 years I didn‚Äôt want to sit around for 2 hours and wait for her to show up if she even did.  I told her I was going to bed and she was cool with everything.  

I have no idea how the hell to approach this situation next time it happens.  I‚Äôve been around her dozens of times and have seen her in every state from sober to absolutely smashed.  I clearly know when someone is too fucked up to consent to anything but I‚Äôm not sure I could even do anything if she had only had a few as I‚Äôm just uncomfortable with the whole thing.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say.",8

In the morning I went to meet up with the same group of friends for breakfast.  When I walked in they were calling me Dick Ripper.  Made no sense to me. 

My friend explained:

""Last night you tackled [Friend] into a grill and the side tray hit his dick and cut it halfway off.  He had to go get 7 stitches to put his weiner back on.  You just left and we had to call an ambulance.  He's still in the hospital.""

3840,"Weekend Discussion Thread for the Weekend of May 21, 2021",0.84,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here‚Äôs what I mean: I‚Äôd bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill‚Äîthere are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can‚Äôt even really explain how‚Äîthey just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn‚Äôt help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don‚Äôt like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. 

I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",12

For instance, say I deposit funds sufficient to push account balance over $25 k (at least 2 business days) before I PDT over the course of a few weeks. After those weeks are over, I cash out, bringing my balance back below $25k, but I no longer PDT after doing so. 

In that scenario, would I still be flagged as a PDT and would the account become frozen for 90 days as soon as I took my money out, leaving me unable to make non PDT trades with any remaining funds? Basically what I‚Äôm getting at, is that once I‚Äôm flagged as a PDT must I always keep the account above $25k from there on to avoid a penalty, or could I go back below $25k, provided I did not PDT‚Äôd after doing so?",3

4422,Market Timing vs Pricing,0.73,"i mean this is all true, but check out the returns for value investing compared to momentum chasers

it's not even comparable

most of the time i am grabbing bites of the market here and there as sentiment waxes and wanes. then occasionally i see the market got something totally fucking wrong and i push all my chips in and walk away from the table. last time i did this, i retired at 40. next time i'll buy a villa somewhere fancy.",7
4423,Market Timing vs Pricing,0.73,"This right here is why PTON is up 15% in 2 weeks. Half the trouble is just identifying clear opportunities. Oh! A stationary bike company is losing 30-40% of it's value to a product issue that amounts to less than 5% of their revenue? That along with the bottom for COVID stocks was an opportunity, still is one tbh",5

While I 100% appreciate Graham/Warren and value investing, this is 100% not the sub for it my dude. Take this to r/stocks, r/investing or r/valueinvesting (that last one might laugh you out of the room because The Intelligent Investor is baby's first read for them)(

WSB is for blowing up your account (or becoming a millionaire) in a single trade and bragging about it afterwards. Graham is way too tame for a place like this.",21

4431,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,My 33 shares and I are excited for this. I think it's time to buy more.,5
4432,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,"Copy pasta my old comment:

""Nokia is only western company which offers complete end to end solutions. When huawei gets foothold positions in western telecom companies it pushes other industry to make own private networks. Whats the best place to buy your equipment for that? :) nokia has double digit grow for private networks.

Bonus thing is that there is major movement to stop huawei's western expansion. Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares).""

Also nokia offers fastest inhouse switch fabric (FP4) and competitors have nothing to compete against that. Nokia is gaining market share from cisco etc. Because of this chip. Google ""Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world‚Äôs first 1T deployment"". Theres this line: ""Most networks are still operating a multitude of 100GE ports, with 400GE on the horizon. Nokia‚Äôs trial with Elisa is proving out terabit interfaces today.""

I personally work in telecom industry and I see Nokia as great investment for atleast next 10 years. It has been bashed for a reason before and because of that Nokia has negative weight of history. We can use that for our longterm gain.",3

4434,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,"The real question is how are they going to compete with COVID 5G? Now with so many people vaccinated, MSFT can use science things mixed with gypsy magic to leverage the COVID 5G network for an unbeatable 5G pipeline that can‚Äôt be hacked. 

Also Nokia cant get the 5G directly into our bodies unless Billyboy allows it, so MSFT gets the royalties from licensing that shit.",12
4435,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,"I always go back to Pekka‚Äôs comments from his last few presentations. It‚Äôs basically this, ‚ÄúNokia has picked up roughly 50% of revenue on contracts that have changed hands in the last 3 years.‚Äù

Essentially, he‚Äôs saying that for every $1 in revenue Huawei loses because of all of the bans, Nokia is picking up .50 cents in revenue.

They demolished their previous earnings and there is a small rumor from a Finnish firm that they think Nokia will raise guidance in their next earnings. Their current guidance puts them around a $75B market cap company in 2023 if they received the same valuation the rest of the 5G market gets. So around ~3x from it‚Äôs current price.",8
