2,It is what it is...,0.88,Imagine explaining to your parents that your marrying someone this fucking nuts about GME?,3
3,It is what it is...,0.88,You got her a car and she wasnt even your fiance? Lulz xd,7
4,It is what it is...,0.88,She probably left because she's realised she's gonna end up marrying an idiot who let Reddit convince him a failing game retailer is gonna be worth $1m a share,10
5,It is what it is...,0.88,Lesson here to the younger cats - don't stick your dick in crazy and put effort into learning about your partner before you try marry them and buy them expensive shit. Start with her family then friends - it will usually give you a good idea what they are really like.,14
6,It is what it is...,0.88,"I feel for your situation, but usually these things aren't about the money. I know you mentioned a ring, car etc., but there's so much more that goes into a healthy relationship. I hope you dust yourself off and live your best life. These things have a way of showing people what they really want and need. Best of luck.",3
7,It is what it is...,0.88,"Marriage is fucked in the West. Imagine buying a 10k ring but they don't have a house yet. If they gone through with the wedding, I'd bet it'd be at least 50k.",37
8,It is what it is...,0.88,Was she hot tho?,13
9,It is what it is...,0.88,"get your shit back, you cuck",44
10,It is what it is...,0.88,"Just remember it could be worse! My ex wife apparently didn’t like the divorce agreement almost a year later and had our divorce agreement opened and shredded in court. Got a financial restraining order put on me and now wants my part of my stock, the house and lots more. Here in WA I guess you don’t need any proof of wrong doing just say you think it was unfair🤣 less work for 2020 and 2021 and eating at my folks house. Monthly grocery bill is half and half, coffee and sugar 🤣🤣🤣🤣 cheer up always! It will shine on a dogs @$$ every once and a while",4
11,It is what it is...,0.88,"this is getting to be some religious stupor tier fantasy

you must be young if you still hold onto the belief that those who deserve punishment will receive it

btw buying people things doesn't make them stay with you, and giving people shit with that intention is at least equally as fucked up as whatever you're suggesting she did wrong in leaving you anyway",5
12,It is what it is...,0.88,She found out about your boyfriend didn’t she?,9
13,It is what it is...,0.88,"get your shit back, betabuxx",46
14,It is what it is...,0.88,"Lame ass post 

Calls on the gf heard she has new car and possibly may have some cash on hand",24
15,It is what it is...,0.88,"Sounds like my story but is was a 70K ring and a 162K Benz. I really wanted to be the “nice guy” and not take back gifts and just walk away with my head high. However, like DoubleJacknCoke said we did this for women who weren’t even our wives yet. We were dumb fucking apes to do so 🦍 

I am happy to report the spouses have been reunited and all is well. Not her and I of course but my Mercedes Benz now has his wife back in the garage with him with a beautiful 3.75K ring in the cup holder.   

Do what is right for you and trust your gut. Get the ring and the car back. She didn’t respect you enough to honor her commitment so you don’t need to respect her any further and you should command the respect owed to you and take your shit back, now!! Good luck and things will get better soon!!",16
16,It is what it is...,0.88,You always buy a cheap ass ring first. Also please tell me the car is just in your name,18
17,It is what it is...,0.88,She just did you the biggest favor.... You may not realize it now... But you will.... Stay strong brother,30
18,It is what it is...,0.88,After this moons she will be back for at least a game of just the tip. Be safe.,16
19,It is what it is...,0.88,Get the ring & whip back and buy in on these low prices!  ASAP!  Now that’s an investment you’ll crush!,6
20,It is what it is...,0.88,"Why did you leave the spot, just as much yours as it is hers. Stay strong ape 🦍",10
21,It is what it is...,0.88,Imagine having a significant other,50
22,It is what it is...,0.88,GME holder and all that but go get that ring and car back ape,28
23,It is what it is...,0.88,"You’re repossessing the ring and whip though, right?",227
24,It is what it is...,0.88,Your problem isn’t being poor its that devil women. And poor financial decisions to finance a car for someone that isn’t your wife.,5
25,It is what it is...,0.88,Stop putting your faith in a fucking ticker and get the damn ring and car back or you're going to end up both lonely and poor.,106

122,US Commerce Department seeks to double tariffs on Canadian Lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%,0.9,"Gurgle.. gurgle.. gurgle... \*holding breath\* pffffffftt  \*Coughs\*

Many moons a-go during the depression people disassembled entire ghost towns to build their new home in the nearby larger town. Mining camps from the gold rush, and cattle stops from the Midwest were dissembled and used to build homes and outbuildings because the cost of goods and transportation of those good were too expensive then. Oh, coming to a theater near you in a decade or so. 

What caused this was at the end of the roaring 20s right before the margin bubble burst, the Govt. had issued tariffs (Smoot\_hawley act) on many soft commodities because use was so high but demand fell and prices still needed to be high (visibly) this was done under the guise of Nationalism. Shit fell apart anyways, we tried even deeper nationalistic legislation to no avail.

As we try this similar legislation, it is just to deflect the deflation that will hit the lumber market soon. All those orders to fill, placed 6 months to a year out, and we are already seeing the napalm hitting the fan. (I love the smell of ON/repo markets in the morning)

161,Inflation: Bullish or Bearish?,0.89,"Turkish stock market is a terrible bear market since 2013 in dollar parity. The index came from $500 to like $150. It only seems like appreciating because of the bad monetary policies like keeping interest rates irresponsibly low for political gains and causing hyperinflation in the end, plus large trade deficits mostly due to energy dependence. In reality, the index can't catch up with inflation.

Fed is both better equipped and politically more independent than Turkish CB. Even if they weren't, people would flee to gold and less inflationary foreign currency and stock market would have troubles catching up with inflation. Solid companies that can increase their earnings percentages in an inflationary environment too.

Source: I am Turkish. I hold gold and some mid term plays like refineries in Turkish stocks. We have fucking extremely cheap stocks but shit won't change until there is a political change in my country.

I hang with a small circle and I don’t have any issues with being around others that drink.  I’ve gone out to the bar a handful of times with friends but it’s really not my scene anymore.  Just about every relationship or hookup I’ve ever had started at the bar or with alcohol involved.  Last weekend I got a booty call from a former FWB that I used to drink a lot with and hookup.  She texted at around midnight right as I was heading to bed.  She was at the bar and I told her she could stop by and she said it wouldn’t be until around 2.  I really thought about it and although it has been 2 years I didn’t want to sit around for 2 hours and wait for her to show up if she even did.  I told her I was going to bed and she was cool with everything.  

I have no idea how the hell to approach this situation next time it happens.  I’ve been around her dozens of times and have seen her in every state from sober to absolutely smashed.  I clearly know when someone is too fucked up to consent to anything but I’m not sure I could even do anything if she had only had a few as I’m just uncomfortable with the whole thing.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say.",9

In the morning I went to meet up with the same group of friends for breakfast.  When I walked in they were calling me Dick Ripper.  Made no sense to me. 

My friend explained:

""Last night you tackled [Friend] into a grill and the side tray hit his dick and cut it halfway off.  He had to go get 7 stitches to put his weiner back on.  You just left and we had to call an ambulance.  He's still in the hospital.""

2391,"Weekend Discussion Thread for the Weekend of May 21, 2021",0.84,"""The problem is that technical analysis is a misnomer. Reading a chart is much more like playing piano than it is like running an analysis. Thus, we have entirely the wrong image for its study.  
  
Here’s what I mean: I’d bet that 90% of people who set out to play piano give up long before ever learning to play at a proficient level. An academic could argue, after a study of all people who have ever played piano, that playing piano is not statistically possible. In fact, it appears to be more about luck than skill—there are few variables that correlate to people who play piano well.  
  
What does correlate? Practice. People who practice piano everyday, for years, are the people who can play well. We can’t even really explain how—they just do. You can run all the linear regressions you want, all the mathematical analysis you want, it doesn’t help because you have approached the problem in entirely the wrong manner.  
  
Here is what we do know:  
  
1. The human mind is currently the most powerful pattern recognition software in the universe.  
a. Therefore, it recognizes nonexistent patterns in randomness.  
b. Therefore, it is capable of recognizing very subtle signals in noise.  
2. To recognize actual patterns, the mind must be trained.  
3. If something is profitable, people will do it.  
a. If something is not profitable, people will eventually stop doing it.  
4. People don’t like to work hard.  
  
Those facts combine to yield some interesting results. For example, combine 1a, 2, 3, and 4, and you have a recipe for crappy training programs (which we see a ton of). Combine 1a, 3a, and 4, and technical analysis ceases to exist.  
  
If you combine all of them, you get exactly what we see in the world: a TON of crappy training programs, a TON of people who put in little to no work then stop, and very few people who achieve any level of proficiency and reap hard-won profits.  
  
Which is exactly what you find with playing the piano.""

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. 

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. 

I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",12

2476,"Weekend Discussion Thread for the Weekend of May 21, 2021",0.84,"Noob question….how long must the minimum equity requirement of $25k remain in an account to satisfy the PDT rule and avoid 90 day PDT suspension?

For instance, say I deposit funds sufficient to push account balance over $25 k (at least 2 business days) before I PDT over the course of a few weeks. After those weeks are over, I cash out, bringing my balance back below $25k, but I no longer PDT after doing so. 

In that scenario, would I still be flagged as a PDT and would the account become frozen for 90 days as soon as I took my money out, leaving me unable to make non PDT trades with any remaining funds? Basically what I’m getting at, is that once I’m flagged as a PDT must I always keep the account above $25k from there on to avoid a penalty, or could I go back below $25k, provided I did not PDT’d after doing so?",3

2980,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,"Copy pasta my old comment:

""Nokia is only western company which offers complete end to end solutions. When huawei gets foothold positions in western telecom companies it pushes other industry to make own private networks. Whats the best place to buy your equipment for that? :) nokia has double digit grow for private networks.

Bonus thing is that there is major movement to stop huawei's western expansion. Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares).""

Also nokia offers fastest inhouse switch fabric (FP4) and competitors have nothing to compete against that. Nokia is gaining market share from cisco etc. Because of this chip. Google ""Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment"". Theres this line: ""Most networks are still operating a multitude of 100GE ports, with 400GE on the horizon. Nokia’s trial with Elisa is proving out terabit interfaces today.""

I personally work in telecom industry and I see Nokia as great investment for atleast next 10 years. It has been bashed for a reason before and because of that Nokia has negative weight of history. We can use that for our longterm gain.",3

2983,Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson,0.92,"I always go back to Pekka’s comments from his last few presentations. It’s basically this, “Nokia has picked up roughly 50% of revenue on contracts that have changed hands in the last 3 years.”

Essentially, he’s saying that for every $1 in revenue Huawei loses because of all of the bans, Nokia is picking up .50 cents in revenue.

They demolished their previous earnings and there is a small rumor from a Finnish firm that they think Nokia will raise guidance in their next earnings. Their current guidance puts them around a $75B market cap company in 2023 if they received the same valuation the rest of the 5G market gets. So around ~3x from it’s current price.",8

I have no problems with execution.  I also was approved for margin and L2 options pretty easily.  Sure it took a few days but that's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things and frankly necessary.",3

3002,"After almost 20 years of generally being very happy with Schwab, I am changing brokers. A short summary of my grievances.",0.88,"I have a IBKR and Schwab account and here are my observations:

Things that bother me with Schwab:

1. Higher options trading level approval is pain in the ass 
2. Margin rate is much higher
3. Pre/after hours market is not open for the whole duration, rather \~2h pre/post market
4. Street Smart Edge is unnecessarily complicated and slow to use. Besides, you can't trade all instruments in it - Futures can only be traded in Street Smart Central via browser. Although IBKR's TWS looks archaic, I find it more streamlined and faster in use.
5. You have to set up separate trades to buy/sell during regular and extended trading sessions (In IBKR you can tick the ""include extended hours"" box). This one is really annoying - for example, I want a GTC order to buy AAPL at $100. I don't care if it will be executed during standard trading session or after hours or tomorrow morning - I just want it bought (or sold) at a particular price. That's impossible to do with Schwab. You have to set it up separately for each and every extended hours trading. Super annoying.
6. Pre/post market is unavailable for 5 mins just before or just after standard trading session. There's no such 5 min break with IBKR. Super annoying.
7. Standard margin requirement for holding particular shares is 30%. If I sell cash covered put, it will require 100% margin. If put gets executed, and I'm assigned shares, the required margin will again be 30%. I guess this has something to do with your option level approval but I don't see why higher options approval level changes the basic math. Very illogical and super super annoying.

Good things with Schwab (comparing with IBKR):

1. Zero fee shares trading
2. Schwab zero fees debit card
3. Support is generally more knowledgeable and accommodating. IBKR has a great support as well only if you get a US customer service representative. The problem is most of the times you'll get Indian with poor knowledge of the products.

And here you are apes, those are my observations.",9

When I transferred my assets to Schwab, they gave me a lower level of options privileges than I had at my previous brokerage.
